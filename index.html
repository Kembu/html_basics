          <P class="paragraph">For every coin you earn you must decide upon an amount that you should always keep for yourself. <br> Not every coin that is earned can be laid claim upon as yours as there are expenses that must be paid as a cost of living and others as you wish. A percentage of what is earned must be kept for oneself. Is it not foolish to be working for other people? Is it not foolish to work all your life and have nothing to show for it? Better be a slave as you will get food, shelter and clothing for free than work and have nothing as a result of the work that you have done. This happens because you have not been paying yourself but always paying others. You must pay yourself first and have something to show for work you have done. </P>
            <blockquote class="quotes"><q> you not pay the garment- maker? Do you not pay 
              the sandal-maker? Do you not pay for the things you eat? Can you live in 
              Babylon without spending? What have you to show for your earnings of the 
              past mouth? What for the past year? Fool! You pay to everyone but yourself. 
              Dullard, you labor for others. As well be a slave and work for what your 
              master gives you to eat and wear. If you did keep for yourself one-tenth of all 
              you earn, how much would you have in 
              ten years?</q> </blockquote>

          <P class="paragraph">Control your desires or they wll control you. Uncontrolled desires are the root causes to unnecessary expenses. <br>As a man thinketh and so is he, and so your desires will continue to grow as long as you continue to make decisions subconciously and not think about them. Like weeds that grow in a garden, desires run wild and take over if they are not kept in check. The purpose of your budget is to help yourself and keep your desires in check so that they do not run wild. </P>
          <blockquote class="quotes"> <q> desirest thou the most? Is it the gratification of thy desires of each 
            day, a jewel, a bit of finery, better raiment, more food; things quickly gone 
            and forgotten? Or is it substantial belongings, gold, lands, herds, 
            merchandise, income-bringing investments? The coins thou takest from thy 
            purse bring the first. The coins thou leavest within it will bring the latter.</q> </blockquote>

          <P class="paragraph">One must take time and learn where to invest money so that it continues growning. <br> Kepping a part of what you earn is just not enough, because a coin saved is a slave that you can wisely put to use in order to capture other slaves bring them back.  </P>
          <blockquote class="quotes"> <q>   Every gold piece you save is a 
            slave to work for you. Every copper it earns is its child that also can earn for 
            you. If you would become wealthy, then what you save must earn, and its 
            children must earn, that all may help to give to you the abundance you crave</q></blockquote>

            <ul><li><h2 class="header2">I MUST GUARD MYSELF AGAINST LOSSES</h2></li></ul>
         <p class="paragraph">As it takes time to earn and a lot of discipline to keep what you earn, you must guard yourself against losses. You must strive to take intelligent risks and avoid taking moronic ones. Intelligent risks are ones which have a great upside potential and lower downside. Investing in a startup company which you have researched and bought its stock for a good reasonable price is an example of an intelligent risk while putting all your money in a lottery hoping you will win is a moronic risk. <br>Most imporatntly, you must learn to learn from your losses as striving for great upsides has its fair share of downsides.
          </p>  
          <blockquote class="quotes"> <q> Guard 
            thy treasure from loss by investing only where thy principal is safe, where it 
            may be reclaimed if desirable, and where thou will not fail to collect a fair 
            rental. Consult with wise men. Secure the advice of those experienced in the 
            profitable handling of gold. Let their wisdom protect thy treasure from 
            unsafe investments </q></blockquote>

            <ul><li><h2 class="header2">I MUST INVEST IN MYSELF</h2></li></ul>
        
          <p class="paragraph">The best investment that one can make is in him/herself. As compound interest works with money, compound interest also works if you continue cultivating skills which will serve you in the long run. Dare not think that work is reserved for slaves as hard work is what makes one move foward in life and when paired with commitment, it separates the successful in life from the ones just fairing on normally. </p>
          <blockquote class="quotes"> <q>"The more of wisdom we know, the more we may earn. That man who seeks 
            to learn more of his craft shall be richly rewarded. If he is an artisan, he may 
            seek to learn the methods and the tools of those most skillful in the same 
            line. If he laboreth at the law or at healing, he may consult and exchange 
            knowledge with others of his calling. If he be a merchant, he may continually 
            seek better goods that can be purchased at lower prices.</q></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="quotes"> <q>If thou plow a hectare, 
            that's a good day's work and any master knows it. But when thou plow only a 
            half, that's shirking. I don't shirk. I like to work and I like to do good work, for 
            work is the best friend I've ever known. It has brought me all the good things 
            I've had, my farm and cows and crops, everything.</q></blockquote>
